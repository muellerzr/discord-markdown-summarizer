# discord-markdown-summarizer
A discord bot for summarizing posts into a pretty markdown

Operates by having a user dictate a start and end message. By default it uses 'ðŸ˜„' and 'ðŸ˜¢' (this can be modified in bot.js). 

After a summary is requested it will be saved to the users clipboard, and a DM will be opened with a markdown file as well for a backup

auth.json should be made based on your Discord bot. I followed these directions: [How to make a Discord bot](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-make-a-discord-bot/#:~:text=%20How%20to%20make%20a%20Discord%20bot%20,User%2C%20look%20for%20the%20words%20Token%3A...%20More%20)
