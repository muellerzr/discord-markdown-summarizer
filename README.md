# discord-markdown-summarizer
A discord bot for summarizing posts into a pretty markdown

Operates by having a user dictate a start and end message. By default it uses 'ðŸ˜„' and 'ðŸ˜¢' (this can be modified in bot.js). 

After a summary is requested it will be saved to the users clipboard, and a DM will be opened with a markdown file as well for a backup
